# Review-based Recommender Systems: A Survey of Approaches, Challenges and Future Perspectives

Welcome to the official repository for our comprehensive survey on Review-based Recommender Systems. This work delves into the integration of textual reviews into recommender systems, highlighting methodologies, challenges, and future directions in this evolving domain. If you are aware of a relevant paper related to our work, please feel free to email me the paper title and publication details at emrul.phy@gmail.com. I would be glad to review it for inclusion.

# Overview

Recommender systems are pivotal in guiding users through vast digital content. While traditional systems primarily rely on explicit ratings or implicit interactions, the rich information embedded in user-generated textual reviews offers deeper insights into user preferences and item characteristics. This survey systematically explores the landscape of review-based recommender systems, emphasizing the significance of textual data in enhancing recommendation quality and interpretability.
