# Overview

Recommender systems are pivotal in guiding users through vast digital content. While traditional systems primarily rely on explicit ratings or implicit interactions, the rich information embedded in user-generated textual reviews offers deeper insights into user preferences and item characteristics. This survey systematically explores the landscape of review-based recommender systems, emphasizing the significance of textual data in enhancing recommendation quality and interpretability.
